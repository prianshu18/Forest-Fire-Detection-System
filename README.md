# Forest-Fire-Detection-System
Successfully implemented a working prototype (embedded device) of a Forest Fire Detection System, wherein Flame Sensors were used to detect fires.
Cloud computing was used to relay sensor data to emergency services.
A wireless mininum spanning tree (MST) topology was created to connect all the sensors for fast and reliable
hop-to-hop communication.
The results can be viewed in the project report.
